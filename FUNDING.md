# ARR Funding Model (Draft)

Status: Draft  
Last updated: 2026-02-04

## Principle

ARR funding exists to ship open infrastructure, not to create ownership control.

## Open Collective profile draft

ARR is an open protocol for creative attribution in the age of AI.  
It provides cryptographically signed attestations that travel with creative works.

ARR is:
- free to implement,
- not controlled by a company,
- designed for recognition, not legal enforcement.

Contributions fund:
- reference implementations (CLI + SDKs),
- integration tooling,
- security and protocol hardening,
- documentation and conformance resources.

## Spending policy

Funds are prioritized in this order:
1. reference implementation delivery,
2. conformance and testing infrastructure,
3. integration grants and ecosystem tooling,
4. security review and legal review of protocol docs,
5. minimal operations (domain, hosting, admin overhead).

## Donor non-control policy

Donations do not provide:
- governance rights,
- editorial control over the specification,
- privileged protocol access,
- exclusive implementation rights.

## Milestone-based funding targets

| Milestone | Target | Unlock |
|---|---:|---|
| M1 | $2,000 | CLI + conformance fixtures |
| M2 | $5,000 | JS SDK + docs |
| M3 | $10,000 | first integration grant + contributor cycle |
| M4 | $20,000 | independent security review |

## Transparency commitment

All incoming and outgoing funds must be traceable through public entries.
Every funded deliverable should map to:
- an issue or bounty spec,
- a merged implementation artifact,
- a closure note with acceptance evidence.
